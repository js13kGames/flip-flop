# flip-flop #

## Credits ##

flip-flop is based on the solitaire variant of Jack Neal's [Decktet][] game
[Jacynth][]. The starting layout is now left up to the player and the
probability of a card changing when played is shown.

### Graphics ###

All the graphics for flip-flip are created with HTML5 and CSS3. The LEDs are
based on [F. Stephen Kirschbaum's CSS LED lights][leds]. The buttons are based
[Sara Soueidan's soft button][button].  The graph paper is a recolor of
[Lea Verou's blueprint grid pattern][paper]. The PCB background is a recolor of
[Paul Salentiny's honeycomb pattern][hex].
